## Issues
##### We are accepting issues on this repository but please read the following rules before posting one. If your issue is not following the rules, there is a high chance that it will be closed and locked:

* Do not post your general usage questions as an issue. If you need help for using certain feature in our template (`How to use Scrumboard` or `How to install the template` etc.), post your questions to our ticket system: [withinpixels.ticksy.com](http://withinpixels.ticksy.com)
* You CAN post your feature requests as an issue. We will add an appropriate label on it so other people can vote for it if they want that feature as well.
* Try to be descriptive as much as possible. Faster we understand and reproduce the issue, faster we can solve.
* We (Core team) have some strict rules and habits when it comes to coding. Please be respectful against our habits and work flow.
* Be patient, kind and respectful.
